        <p>Howdy all!  The new year is coming, as is a new server for Ctrl-C.club (yay!).  To keep our community happy and healthy, I wanted to let everybody know that we'll have some new policies in the coming year.</p>

        <p>I've tried to keep the rules on Ctrl-C.club slim, but due to some confusion and the behavior of some bad actors, I feel it's important to clarify some of the expectations on the server.</p>

        <p>Ctrl-C.club's new policies:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>No Eggdrop bots.</li>
            <p>As much as I love seeing the neat things that people build, too many sketchy individuals have simply been using our service to run their eggdrop bots, and enough of these have been used for nefarious purposes that I no longer feel comfortable allowing them to run freely on the server.  If you're running or would like to run an eggdrop for non-nefarious purposes, please reach out to me to discuss (See "Contacting the Admin" below).</p>
            <p>Any eggdrop services that are still running will be manually stopped on January 9, 2021.  Any users that restart an eggdrop without prior discussion will be summarily removed.</p>

        <li>No services that duplicate Ctrl-C.club services.</li>
            <p>This means no email servers, IRC servers, web servers, Gemini servers, etc.  Although a small web server to test an app is fine, if you'd like to make it generally available please reach out to me (See "Contacting the Admin" below) and we'll see about making it available through our Nginx server.</p>

        <li>No virtualized/subsystem OSes</li>
            <p>This includes docker, junest, vagrant, and so forth.  These are all very heavy on our system, and if you need a different OS, there are probably better solutions out there for you than Ctrl-C.club.</p>

        <li>No Bitcoin/crypto mining</li>
            <p>We just don't have the power on the server to do it, and it negatively affects all our users.</p>

        <li>No hosting/storage of illegal (in the US) or pirated material.</li>
            <p>This could get our whole server shut down, let's keep Ctrl-C.club working and wholesome for everybody!</p>

        <li>No spamming of any kind</li>
            <p>Nobody likes spam.  Don't be that guy/gal.</p>

        <li>No hacking or attempting to get into other people's accounts/servers.</li>
            <p>This one kind of goes without saying.</p>

        <li>One gigabyte storage limit</li>
            <p>This has been a soft limit for a while, but the rules were hard to find or understand, and it has been unevenly enforced.  With the available space on the server getting a little tight, it makes sense to clear out some old data and make room for people to experiment.  It's not a problem if you go over a bit on a temporary basis; we're not setting disk quotas.  Just make sure to tidy up after yourself. :)</p>
            <p>If you need a little more room than this, feel free to reach out (See "Contacting the Admin" below).</p>
            <p>If you're already over this limit, you'll be contacted at the email you signed up with by January 9, 2021.  If there is no response within two weeks, your account will be archived.  The data will be kept available for re-upload if you reach back out to me.</p>

        <li>We want to show off how awesome our users are!</li>
            <p>Our users make cool stuff, and I love showing it off!  Do reach out if you've made something neat (or know someone who's made something neat), I want to highlight it on our homepage.  Or if you have a thought on how to better show off what our users are doing, let me know!</p>
    </ul>

        <p>I want to thank all our users who have made (and continue to make!) Ctrl-C.club such a great and cool and wholesome place over the years.  I love that we're doing so many awesome things.  I hope you all have a wonderful Christmas season, and as always, learn a bunch and have fun!</p>
