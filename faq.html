        Think of it as a dirty open-source hippie handing out freebies in order to make more dirty open-source hippies.

    <a name="installs">What programs are available in my Ctrl-C Club account?</a>
    <p>A bunch.  Working on a list.</p>

    <a name="needmore">Can I get [package] installed?</a>
    <p>Probably!  Send an email with your suggestion to <a href="mailto:admin@ctrl-c.club">admin@ctrl-c.club</a></p>

    <a name="howmuchdisk">How much disk space do I get?</a>
    <p>The short answer is that there are no "hard" limits, but keep in mind that Ctrl-C.club is a shared resource.  Let's all be good neighbors!</p>
    <p>
        There's plenty of space for most kinds of development, basic data storage, etc., but please don't use it as a place to keep your music/movie collection.  As a rule of thumb, using a few hundred megs should be fine, but once you start getting over that, it may be time to look at what you're trying to accomplish and consider whether Ctrl-C.club is the right place to keep those things.
    </p>
    <p>
        If there's something you'd like to do that you think might use too much space, get in touch at <a href="mailto:admin@ctrl-c.club">admin@ctrl-c.club</a> and we'll work something out!
